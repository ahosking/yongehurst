        <p>All of our products are developed from <strong>start-to-finish</strong> at our distillery in Toronto.
          <strong>We do not buy "neutral" spirit and flavour it</strong> (as many distilleries do) - that's just not
          what we believe in. By controlling the entire process through agricultural input, yeast, fermentation and
          distillation, we ensure <strong>all</strong> of our small batch products are worth taking home to share with
          friends and family.</p>
        <p>As a result of our limited fermentation capacity and dedication to the full life-cycle of our spirits, we
          will occasionally sell out of products or limit availability. We will do our best to update the status of our
          products below; Please feel free to drop us a line by <a href="#visitus">email or social media</a> for

              <p>What originally began as a Libation Lab experiment, we loved it so much we gave it a full release.
                Rather than making a vodka that tastes like it came straight from an industrial chemical plant, we
                crafted a smooth sipper from Canadian-grown potatoes, and gave it a light filtration to develop one of
                the best "traditional" vodkas your lips have ever tasted.</p>

                from <a href="http://ontariosake.com/">Izumi (right here in Toronto!)</a> a second life by distilling it
                into a kasutori shochu using a traditional single distillation. A North American take on one of Asia's

        <h2><img src="img/yongehurst-logo-white-lg.png" alt="Yongehurst Logo" /></h2>

        <p>As two long-time friends with a passion for spirits, history and hand-crafting everything, we set out to
          explore our families' proud traditions, while looking to develop a few traditions of our own.</p>

        <p>As the culture of whisky and cocktails continues to grow in Ontario, the selection of interesting and
          available spirits isn't keeping up with the demand. As big supporters of independent craftspeople, from
          brewers to bartenders to baristas, we saw an opportunity to fill a void and share some of our knowledge and
          skill.</p>

        <p>Makers by nature and by nurture, our desire to experiment and balance flavour and science will bring a series
          of unique spirits to the people and place we call home. </p>

        <p>After years of planning and experimenting, Yongehurst Distillery Company is finally here in Toronto and we
          hope you're as excited as we are.</p>
